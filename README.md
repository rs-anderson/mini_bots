# mini_bots
CuR mini is an annual fresher's project to introduce newcomers the Robotics Society. It is similar to IDP (Integrated Design Project, a year 2 coursework project for Engineering), members involved will be given a set of parts and will have to make a robot by themselves under guidance from committee members.

The idea is by the end of this project, participants will be able to use some tools and work on bigger projects.

The challenge this year is to build a robot that competes with other robots to pick up target objects in an arena. The goal it to successfully take as many targets as possible to the scoring zone in the time given.

At the end of Michaelmas term, we will hold an in-person competition (Dec 1, Wednesday) where the robots will be competing against each other.
